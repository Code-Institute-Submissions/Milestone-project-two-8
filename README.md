## Project Features 🎨
This project has a few interesting features that I feel need special mention.

* Responsive Navigation Bar: The navigation bar is sticky and  changes to a dropdown menu in smaller screens.
* Navbar Background colour: Initially the navigation bar doesn't have any colour. As the user scrolls down the page the navigation bar gets a background colour applied to it. By doing this it allows the navigation links to remain visible and not get obscured by the lighter colours on some of the section backgrounds.
* Image slider : 3D imageslider as a hero image on index page takes users action on rotating images created by using JS
* Images:  The  images on all pages are responsive and draws users attention.
* Responsive travel cards: The travelcards in  Vacation page  are designed to draw attention of users with eye catching backgrounds ,images and offers users can choose to travel.
* Offers : offers in index page is created using JS which changing time in seconds,minutes,hours and days.
* Testimony : users can view clients reviews by moving cursors on images and with changed text ,created by using JS
* Contact Form : The form takes users input  and can take users  message with a map of travel agency address using JS and API.
* Footer :  Users have inforamtive footer with social links.
* Footer Date: The date on the footer updates itself automatically through the use of JQuery.

## Project Strategy

When creating this project I needed to develop an overall strategy which would help me to understand the purpose of this project. I needed to keep these ideas in mind when implementing the completed design.

1. Demonstrate the skills that I have acquired from the Code Institute curriculam thus far and pass the assesment criteria of Code Institute.
2. Create a fully featured front end project that I can use to draw attention to my skills and attract potential users/clients.

With these criteria in mind I determined that a five page fun colourful travel website would be the best option. It would make navigation and organization of the data simple. It would allow me to showcase some of my design ability in creating 3D image slider using JavaScript, date changer in offers  and allow me to focus on primarily HTML , CSS and JavaScript , though it  lack overall complexity ,which I can accomplish by using more technologies in coming projects . I needed to be careful not to overload the user with too much information in the form of text as this could lead to a very cluttered looking site.

The main scope of this project was to demonstrate what I have learned thus far in the Code Institute course with regards to HTML , CSS, JavaScript and I tried to use the best colour combination, the type of fonts, icons ,images and the best layout options for this project.

## The scope of this project

The main scope of this project was to demonstrate what I have learned thus far in the Code Institute course with regards to HTML , CSS and JavaScript. With this in mind I needed to be careful that I didn't get distracted with trying to be overly complex remembering the examination criteria.

A secondary part of the scope for me was to create an attractive site using the above mentioned technologies. For this reason I spent lots of  time  exploring and deciding to use more CSS libraries, JS libraries for the best colour combination, the type of fonts,icons and the best layout options for this project.

## UI / UX

The layout and content of the site has been carfully curated to logically tell the user about **Destinations travel-agency**. The 3D slider section contains an eye catching images that attracts users to explore new places  and is designed to grab attention with more offers. The about us page informs the user about our travel agency and gives them information about their travel options. The Vacation page highlights users with more travel destinations according to their desires. The contact section allows the user to get in touch with us for further information about their travels with interactive map on our location.Finally book now page allows users to book their destination with options to choose activities ,check-in and check-out date with price select slider to book their trip.

## Users stories

To help develop the site I created some user stories from my perspective as the site owner, along with user stories for potential employeers or clients. By doing this, it helped me to identify what was important information that needed to be included and also helped me to identify things that I could leave out so that the site doesn't become overly bloated with content or difficult to navigate.

### My Perspective:

1. As the owner I would like a site that will attract users with eye catching colors ,images and inforamtion.
2. As the owner I would like a site that would allow users to navigate easily.
3. As the owner I would like a site that would showcase travel options with more exciting deals and offers.
4. As the owner I would like a site that would allow a member of the public to contact me.

### Users Perspective:

1. As a user I would like to get a feel to explore more after first look of the site.
2. As a user I would like to get a feel of having more options to choose destinations for travelling.
3. As a user I would like to see more offers ,exciting deals and images of places to explore.
4. As a user I would like to be able to contact the site owner in an easy manner.

## Wireframes 

To help visualize the website I created wireframes of what the site would look like on desktop as well as what it would look like on mobile devices. The wireframes can be found here:

## Design Decisions On The Surface Plain

To implement this project successfully I made certain design decisions that had an impact on the project some of these decisions are:

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is used throughout this project. The use of Bootsrap was choosen as it presented many advantages. The main adavantages of Bootsrap was that it allowed for a complex page layout with the use of its grid system and flexbox utilities. Bootstrap also contains many useful margin and padding classes that reduced the need for repitive CSS . Bootstrap also helped with cross browser compatability. The downsides to using Bootsrap is that it made the HTML code difficult to read and overly complex with regards to the many classes that are applied to the HTML elements.  One final area that Bootstrap had an negative affect on the project was when it came to testing using the CSS validator. The CSS validator did not regonize alot of Bootstrap CSS as valid and raised a lot of errors but if you copy and paste my code directly from style.css into the CSS validator it displays no errors.


### Container

I used the Bootstrap container class extensively throughout this project as I felt it improved the overall look of the site. The container-fluid class is often used as a default by alot of developers but i feel that it places content (espically text content) too close to the screen edges. Most peoples eyes are drawn towards the center of the screen and I feel that by using the container class it provides a better user experience.

### Fonts

The use of fonts was also carefully considered in this project.I mainly used Roboto, sans-serif fonts for all my text and headings .

### CSS and JS libraries

I used most of the libraries for my site icons ,carousel, animations and for date picker.

### Text

For this project I did my best to keep the amount of text to a minimum so as to not overwhelm the user with useless or unneccessary information. With this in mind I tried to keep each block of text to about fifty words. Except for about page where I have to give description about travel agency .

## Testing 📓

Throughout the process of developing this site I regularly checked my code using the W3Schools HTML ,CSS validators and JavaScript validators online.

The results of the HTML validation can be seen in the below image:

![W3 schools HTML validation](https://i0.wp.com/s1.uphinh.org/2020/05/11/html-validator.png)

The CSS validator highlighted a lot of issues and errors when the site was tested by using the URL as input. This is because the site is also testing the Bootstrap style sheet and it does not recognize CSS variables as valid CSS .

The reults of the URL input test can be seen in the screenshot below where it is highlighted that the Bootstrap stylesheet is the cause of the errors:

![Css bootstrap errors](https://i0.wp.com/s1.uphinh.org/2020/05/11/css-1.png) 🐛

When the CSS is inputed directly  can clearly see that there is no fault with any of the CSS that I have created directly as is shown in the below image:

![No Errors CSS](https://i0.wp.com/s1.uphinh.org/2020/05/11/css3.png)

The results of the JS validation can be seen in the below image:
![ JS validation](https://imagehost.imageupload.net/2020/05/10/js-validator.png)

For responsivness I checked a website called am I responvie. I also checked how the site looked on a variety of devices and browsers.
The devices that I checked the site on were:

1. 15 inch HP Laptop
2. 13 inch Macbook pro
3. 21 inch desktop PC
4. Samsung galaxy phone
5. Iphone 4/5/6/7/8/X
6. BlackBerry
The site looked great on all these devices and didn't seem to show any problems.

The browsers I used for testing are as follows:

1. Google Chrome
2. Firefox
3. Safari
4. Microsoft Edge
5. Microsoft Internet Explorer

The site looked perfect and responsive :

```

This site is deployed using a feature of Github known as Github Pages. To make your site go live on the internet you need to follow the following steps:

1. Select the repository that you wish to make live.
2. Make sure that the home page is called index.html
3. At the top of the page click on the settings tab.
4. Once in the settings section scroll down the page untill you get to a section called github pages.
5. Where the option exits to select a branch to deploy change the option from none to master branch.
6. If you have followed these steps correctly the page should reload.
7. Scroll back down to the github pages section and you should see a message that reads something like this: your site is ready to be deployed at username.github.io/example
8. Wait for a few minutes and refresh the page and the if successfully the message should now read: Your site is published at ...

To create a local copy of the project you can select the repository and just above the readme file you will see a button that gives you the option to download or clone the file.
